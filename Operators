#Task 1 We have a database that runs a sports team's website. In the results table we have the columns id, home_team, home_score, away_team, away_score, played_on.
Find all results where the home team's score is above 12.

1. > SELECT * FROM results WHERE home_score > 12;

#Task 2 We're still using the sports team's database. In the results table we have the columns id, home_team, home_score, away_team, away_score, played_on.
Find all results where the away team's score is lower than 10.

2. SELECT * FROM results WHERE away_score<10;
